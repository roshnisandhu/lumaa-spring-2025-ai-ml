# Travel Recommendation System  

This project recommends countries based on user descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. It processes a dataset of country descriptions and matches them to a userâ€™s input to return the top 5 most relevant travel destinations.

I chose to create a travel recommendation system because travel has been a huge inspiration in my life and has increased my appreciation for the world and the people around me by understanding so many different perspectives. Through this challenge, I felt like I could create a platform to inspire more people to explore some place other than where they've lived and grow from that experience in the way they would like to.

## Dataset  
- **File:** `country_descriptions_final.csv`  
- **Source:** I created the dataset myself using BBC's and World Banks country profiles pages. It is a simple table with one sentence descriptions of over 100 countries. I was unable to find a dataset that provided me with text descriptions of countries as the problem statement required, therefore, I built it myself.  
- **Loading Steps:** The dataset is automatically loaded in `main.py`, so no additional steps are required. Ensure the file is in the same directory as the script. It is uploaded to this repo as 'country_descriptions_final.csv'.
